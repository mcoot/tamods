Ok, so this is all of my routes, a lot of them are me just experimenting so they either don't grab or have failed bounces. 

The routes that are all usable are...
2 - Front Left (loop, failed exit)
3 - Back (Tunnel) high
4 - Front Right (with rock bounce)
5 - Front Right (with stand bounce)
6 - Left (ran this recording slow but whatever)
7 - Right 
8 - Front Right (with rock bounce)

   ---Concepts--- 	1  - CW Loop (Failed... before I found the 2nd bounce)
					9  - Front Right (Loop - Failed Bounce post-grab)
					10 - Front Right (Loop - Failed Bounce post-grab)
					11 - Right (loop, Failed bounce pre-grab)
					12 - Right (loop, Failed bounce post-grab)
					13 - Right (loop, Failed bounce post-grab)
					14 - Right (loop, Failed bounce pre-grab)
					15 - Right (loop, Failed bounce post-grab,)
 *Final Iteration*	16 - Right (loop, Failed bounce post-grab, YOU DON'T NEED TO TRY THE BOUNCE POST-GRAB, skiing down the hill works fine)
 
 I know a lot of them are complete but they're all possible to run consitently
		Except for #2 the Front Left, I seem to only hit the 1st bounce on that one maybe 60% of the time
